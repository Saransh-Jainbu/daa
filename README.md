An interactive algorithmic visualization platform that demonstrates the "Dance of the Digits" problem: maximizing a number by performing exactly K swaps between any two digits.

![Application Screenshot](public/screenshot.png)

## üöÄ Features

### Multiple Algorithm Approaches

- **Greedy Algorithm**: Maximizes the number by swapping from left to right, always choosing the largest digit for each position.
- **Backtracking (Optimal) Algorithm**: Explores all possible combinations of swaps to find the guaranteed maximum.

### Interactive Visualization

- Step-by-step visual walkthrough of each algorithm's execution
- Color-coded highlighting of swapped digits
- Detailed explanations for each algorithmic step
- Controls to navigate forwards and backwards through the algorithm's steps

### Educational Components

- **Algorithm Details**: Comprehensive information about each algorithm:
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Advantages and limitations
  - Step-by-step implementation details
  - Optimization techniques

- **Challenge Mode**: Test your understanding with pre-designed challenges:
  - Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Hints and feedback
  - Interactive verification of answers

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare the two algorithms with real-time metrics:
  - Execution time measurements
  - Visual comparison of performance
  - Analysis of results and speed differences

### User-Friendly Features

- **History Tracking**: Save and reuse previous calculations
- **Random Test Generator**: Create random test cases with a single click
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üîß Technical Implementation

The application is built with:

- **React 19** with hooks for state management
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Modern CSS** with animations and responsive design

## üß† The Algorithm Problem

Given a number represented as a string and an integer K, the challenge is to find the maximum possible number after performing at most K swaps between any two digits.

### Example:

```
Input: N = "2736", K = 1
Output: "7236"
```

```
Input: N = "1234", K = 2
Output: "4231"
```

### Algorithm Comparison

| Feature | Greedy Approach | Backtracking Approach |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Time Complexity | O(n¬≤) | O(n! √ó k) |
| Space Complexity | O(n) | O(n √ó k) |
| Optimal Solution | Not always guaranteed | Always guaranteed |
| Best For | Larger inputs, performance-critical scenarios | Smaller inputs, when optimality is required |
